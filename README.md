Caesar Cipher Web Application

This is a simple ASP.NET Core MVC Web App that can be used to encrypt and decrypt text using a Caesar Cipher.
The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that encrypts by shifting characters down the alphabet.

The simplicity of a Caesar Cipher means there is almost no security in these encryptions. This application is merely an exercise.

•To Encrypt:
Enter the text you would like to encrypt into the "Text" field, and the amount of characters you would like to shift by into the "Key" field, and select "ENCRYPT".
•To Decrypt:
Enter the text you would like to decrypt into the "Text" field, and the amount of characters the text was shifted by into the "Key" field, and select "DECRYPT".

This Web App was created as an exercise with the ASP.NET Core MVC Framework, and an exercise in simple encryption and decryption.
